# reaction-times-tester
> Testing reaction times for a school project. (CREST Gold Award)

The code is written in the folder **"src"** and in the file **"reaction-times.py"**, in the Python programming language. Click on the folder, and then the file, to see it. As such, you must have Python downloaded on your computer to run it. Eventually, there will be a file which you can just download and run, instead of having to download python.

Currently, this is merely a proof-of-concept, and it is in the very early stages of development, however the necessary functions are all made already.

A line with # at the start means it is not part of the code, but instead explains what that section of the code does. **Crucially, information about how the code works will be found there.**

### Tips for navigation

If you have not used this website before, this is where programmers from all over the world manage their code. When code from a **"user"** has **"commited"** some code to a **"repository"**, it is uploaded for others to (if they have chosen to) collaborate on. This **"version control"** is the basic principle to organise, manage and share your code.

If you would like to understand more about how this works, draw your attention to the top of the screen.

The **"Code"** section is where you can view the files by clicking on each of them in an organised manner. It is split into **"Branches"**, the one you are on is called **"main"**. Each feature you are working on should have its own individual branch, which helps organise your code. All branches are eventually merged into **"main"**.

The **"Issues"** section is rather intuitive. This is where you upload, talk and track issues about the code. You will see these fill up as the project continues. Sometimes, we assign a specific branch to them.

The **"Pull Requests"** section is a little unintuitive. When you finish creaing a feature, you submit the branch you worked on to be merged into the **"main"** branch. This submission is called a **"pull request."** However, it really should be called a **"push request"**, as you are not pulling the branch, but pushing it into another. However, just know that that is the official name. 

For the purposes of this project, you should not need to understand the other sections, like Actions. Hopefully this quick overview of an extremely useful service helps you better understand the structure of this project and this website.
